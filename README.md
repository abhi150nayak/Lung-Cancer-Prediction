# Lung-Cancer-Prediction(LOGISTIC REGRESSION)
**If you need dataset please feel free to contact me via mail - abhishekdj515@gmail.com

The main aim of this study is to predict the survival rate of the lung cancer patients using logistic regression. We will be analysing the datasets besides logistic regression algorithm to build and develop the classification and prediction model.


•	To predict the effectiveness of the algorithm through accuracy and precision score.
•	To calculate the line plot and bar plot of this linear regression
•	To predict the output based on 0 and 1
•	To calculate the logistic regression using confusion matrix
